      <description>This is one of my one day projects. Created to help me keep focus without my phone or computer. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple timer that can also tell time. For maximum accuracy it syncs with wifi.</description>

      <description>This is a project made in 24h during HackYeah2024 aka. Hackathon. Unfortunately She didn&amp;rsquo;t win but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that with a little bit of tweaking and better preparation next time, there is a huge chance to win.</description>

      <description>A mod for RC. Completely new remote based on LoRa, new and stronger battery, better H-Bridge. All of those improvements make it more pleasurable to drive. And don&amp;rsquo;t worry, with a little persistence It should be possible to mod any RC like that.</description>

      <description>Obsium mk2 is an upgraded version of my beloved Obsium. New version comes with Raspberry Pi 5, 512GB SSD and much more. But those upgrades came at a cost of some functionalities of the previous version.</description>

      <description>Atrovel calculator is a project that originated from one of my schools lessons. We were learning how to use 4x4 button matrix and bored Simon decided that it would be a great idea to make a simple calculator.</description>

      <description>Cyberdecks serve a different purpose for everybody. Some create it purely for fun others try to make a perfect „laptop” like device to fulfil all of their needs. For me it is both.</description>

      <description>This is yet another project made for a contest hosted by Cyberdeck Cafe. The objective was to create a keyboard that, as the name suggests, has only one button. Everything else was up to you.</description>
