Just being able to code for 24h straight (without sleeping\u0026hellip;) solving problems and generally having fun was a great escape from reality.

Bc my friend already had a frog\u0026rsquo;s pixel art that he didn\u0026rsquo;t mind sharing. And finally, what this program is all about?\nChloe is your frogie math tutor. Our idea was to make sth similar to Duolingo but with math instead of languages and more advanced gamification. Sadly we only had 24h, in the middle our friend had to go and there was two of us left. But we managed to bring basic features to this app. And our flag feature is Chloe herself, or should I say her personality. She is cute, but sometimes might get a little bit carried away and start randomly cursing at you for not doing well. But to appease you, she is going to therapy.\nLast words #\rI want this to be an example for all the people that think everything goes wonderfully for others. As you can see, It\u0026rsquo;s not.

So I decided that It will be a great excuse for building this 15kg monstrosity. Also, I wanted my own workstation like this since like 2 year but never had a great enough reason to build it.\nCreations process #\rEvery creation process starts with two things. Searching for inspiration and a lot of money spent. To be transparent, I just call It a Pelican Case, It\u0026rsquo;s not a Peli case.

It all started when my cousin asked me to repair his RC car bc It\u0026rsquo;s not working anymore. So I did. I added a 12V battery, better H-bridge and LoRa communication between this car and the remote. There were a few problems. There got to be some problems. As I learned, classic Arduino Uno is sometimes the best. ESP 32 is 3v3 based so controlling the H-bridge had to be done via transistors, way too complicated. Arduino pro micro has too small memory capacity and don\u0026rsquo;t even get me started on connecting LoRa modules to them. It was a nightmare.

New version comes with Raspberry Pi 5, 512GB SSD and much more. But those upgrades came at a cost of some functionalities of the previous version.\nStory #\rObsium mk2 was a little spontaneous. It was never meant to even exist, but two factors changed my mind: the new Raspberry Pi and the fact that the first Obsium just stopped working. So I ordered Pi5 and waited almost 3 months. It\u0026rsquo;s wild how long It took\u0026hellip; Anyways, while my Pi was being shipped, I ordered M2 hat for it and started work on the design. At first the plan was to use an old case and just modify It, but I ended up creating a whole new case with some tweaks. new (left) and old (right) case comparison\nObsium #\rSpecs #\rObsium mk2 is powered by 8GB version of Raspberry Pi 5 with 512GB Samsung SSD and a 12ish inch Full HD screen.\rBattery #\rBattery is a huge improvement. Mk2 has a replaceable battery and every battery module has It\u0026rsquo;s own 4S bms and 4x2000mAh Li-Ion cells. That gives about 2.5h of work time on a single battery pack.\nKeyboard #\rKeyboard is the same one as on mk1. It\u0026rsquo;s a custom ortholinear keyboard with brown cherry switches. I/Os #\rObsium has rather specific I/O, apart from the obvious ethernet, usb and audio jack, mk2 has an external port for connecting different antennas to built-in SDR. It also has external SATA and a port for powering disk\u0026rsquo;s. With the custom cable connecting HDD drives is no problem. What has changed #\rMany things have changed. Apart from mentioned battery and Pi, the new case is much more comfortable to use, the I/O is also a huge improvement compared to mk1. But what Obsium mk2 lacks compared to mk1 is the integrated LoRa. Last vast improvements are friction hinges. I can\u0026rsquo;t express how much using Obsium has improved with those.\nSecond monitor #\rThanks to having an external 12V port I was able to make a second monitor that could be powered entirely by Obsium. Stats screen #\rAbout a month after finishing Obsium I decided to add a 64x128px OLED display to show me basic stats and the temperature. Can It replace a laptop? #\rNo. Short answer is no. I have been daily driving Obsium for a while. Then I managed to buy a laptop and there are a few things that I have noticed. But before that, a little disclaimer. Comparing cyberdecks to laptops is kinda pointless bc laptops are always gonna be better. Anyway, what I have noticed is that having ARM instead of x86 is a problem. I am not saying that It\u0026rsquo;s a huge issue. But It\u0026rsquo;s a problem, especially for me now when I need to program PLC\u0026rsquo;s and Codesys or TwinCat is only available for x86 windows. Another thing is size, when It sits on a desk or is in a big backpack the thickness is not a problem. But e.g. when I want to take a smaller backpack Obsium takes most of the space. Last thing are thermals. Pi5 has awful thermals and for extended usage at 100% I would be afraid that sth might burn. But apart from that It might be a great computer for somebody that wants to write something from time to time at school or just have the ability to watch a movie or scroll through the internet on a bigger screen and an actual desktop. It\u0026rsquo;s also a great way to learn a lot about electronics, 3D design, linux and more. Last words #\rBoth Obsiums were great projects and I have learned a ton. I definitely won\u0026rsquo;t disassemble this Obsium, It has Its own place in my heart and I just love It too much. Yes, It\u0026rsquo;s not super powerful. Yes, I have a laptop now. But Obsium remains one of my favorite projects.\nStay creative and make cyberdecks\n~Simon\n","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/1724831487281-obsium-mk2/","section":"Projects","summary":"Obsium mk2 is an upgraded version of my beloved Obsium.

We were learning how to use 4x4 button matrix and bored Simon decided that it would be a great idea to make a simple calculator.\nWarning! This project is no longer developed\rA-N-Ulab/ATROVEL-arduino_calculator\rArduino based calculator\rC\u0026#43;\u0026#43; 1\r0\rStory #\rIt all started at one of my technical lessons. We were learning arduino\u0026rsquo;s for a while at that moment. And that day\u0026rsquo;s assignment was learning how to read from a 4x4 button matrix. I, knowing a little bit about arduino, was bored a little bit. So to keep myself \u0026ldquo;entertained\u0026rdquo; I started work on a calculator. Nothing serious, not even doing real calculations, just displaying equations on a serial monitor. But then. after 3 hours of making it, I started to wonder. Could I make an actual calculator? I had to know. The same day, after coming back home, every other project went aside and work on this calculator began. My style of working on projects like this is splitting them into two main tasks: programming and case/electronics. And, as always, programming went first. Atrovel\u0026rsquo;s code might be a little bit rough around the edges, and not optimized as much as I would like. Despite that it works. I would even dare to say that It works quite well. Anyways, after a week of coding and debugging. The code was done and now I had to start working on the enclosure. My first idea was using MX cherry switches but after 5h long print this case turned out waaaaay too big. So I decided on using the original 4x4 button matrix with two additional ones. After stuffing all the electronics inside and closing It with a little amount of force (jk, a lot of force\u0026hellip;) and super glue, came the time to test It. And oh boy have I tested It. One month of using it in school while doing math and physics exams. And all the calculations were correct.\nProblems #\rThere are two main problems with Atrovel. The buttons are kinda shitty, and you have to remember the layout. Another thing is that you are unable to calculate e.g. 2+2 and then make a square root of it. You have to type 4 and then press square root. Will I fix those? Probably not. But Atrovel\u0026rsquo;s spaghetti code will probably be used in another iteration of Otsi\nMaking your own #\rTo create your own Atrovel, just follow the instructions on It\u0026rsquo;s github (link above). If you decide to make your own, I hope it will serve you well. And if you want, you can send your finished calculator to me. I would be delighted to see It\nGallery #\rStay creative\n~ Simon\n","date":"15 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/1725463418726-atrovel-calculator/","section":"Projects","summary":"Atrovel calculator is a project that originated from one of my schools lessons.

Some create it purely for fun others try to make a perfect „laptop” like device to fulfil all of their needs. For me it is both.\nLinks #\rWallpaper Hackaday.io page Hackster.io\u0026rsquo;s article Cyberdeck Cafe\u0026rsquo;s website Cyberdeck Cafe\u0026rsquo;s discord yarh.io - the keyboard design But why? #\rLet\u0026rsquo;s start with a little bit of story behind creating Obsium. It\u0026rsquo;s not my first deck, in fact it\u0026rsquo;s my 8th deck. But why make so many isn\u0026rsquo;t it easier to buy a laptop? - you may ask. Yes it is but the reason for building decks for past 2 years and spending all my money on it was to built something that fits all MY needs and maybe learn something while doing it. So i decided that my last deck has to have:\na big-ish battery exposed gpio my digital oscilloscope LoRa (Long Range messenger) sdr And it has to be flexible. All my previous decks have failed at at least one of this points. But now I\u0026rsquo;ve a deck with all that features (not all i wanted at the beginning but all I mentioned). Yes it\u0026rsquo;s big and Yes laptops are more powerful and I probably could have got away with just taking an additional Arduino with me all the time but i am a masochist that has a 3d printer and some skills. Fusion360 go brrrrr #\rDesigning process wasn\u0026rsquo;t as easy as i have hopped. What i have right now is the second version of Obsium. The first one was cooler but not practical at all. So in the middle of printing and designing I scraped everything and started all over again. I have hoped that my last deck would be thinner but i didn\u0026rsquo;t want to order another PCB and wait another month. Besides that current design incorporates (in my opinion) everything pretty well. old design\nnew design\nI need more I/O #\rOn the left side I have charging port for my custom charger, main switch to power Obsium on and a button to turn on and off the display. The back side has one battery indicator, antena for LoRa and one removable panel with ports and gpios.\rThe right side has a fan switch and is going to have an antena for 100MHz-1GHz SDR And finally the front, It has a label and 2 Allen keys Looking at it from the top you can see a fan, an offset keyboard and a small, not even 1inch LCD.\rA huge time saviour while making Obsium turned out to be using plexi for everything large and flat. It also made Obsium really rigged although i won\u0026rsquo;t throw it around.\nThe inside #\rThe inside might look, at first glance, as one big mess but It\u0026rsquo;s actually a well organized and thought through arrangement of cables. Another huge savior is the PCB I\u0026rsquo;m using cause it allows for a lot of connections (just like every PCB\u0026hellip;) without any extra mess. Although if I could turn back time I would do It differently, sadly from the back ports only the Ethernet is working. Theoretically HDMI is also working but, there has to be some lose connection cause it sometimes lacks a few colors. Also the USB is working but as 2.0 and not 3.0. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why the ports have failed, I have checked all of them before putting this board inside but It still managed to break itself. Now I have to live with that. Specs #\rObsium is powered by a rather unusual raspberry pi 400 board with a M.2 SSD connected via USB 3.0. Powering everything is battery pack made out of 4 Li-ion cells in 4s configuration giving around 40Wh and 16.8V. As a keyboard Obsium is using custom made ortholinear design and configuration by yarh.io but with a few tweaks. Last words #\rFor the next few weeks i\u0026rsquo;m going to be debugging this deck. I have to check GPIO\u0026rsquo;s, LoRa, oscilloscope (that\u0026rsquo;s what the Raspberry Pi Pico is for), SDR and the mini LCD. I would also like to thank Cyberdeck Cafe discord members and my discord friends for all the support and help with making this deck.\n","date":"1 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/1724773805509-obsium/","section":"Projects","summary":"Cyberdecks serve a different purpose for everybody.

The objective was to create a keyboard that, as the name suggests, has only one button. Everything else was up to you.\nWarning! This project is no longer developed\rGlinek/One-key-keyboard\rOne key keyboard for Virtcon 2023\rC\u0026#43;\u0026#43; 1\r0\rCyberdeck Cafe\u0026rsquo;s website Cyberdeck Cafe\u0026rsquo;s discord Creation process #\rThis project took a few weeks which is relatively quick considering the fact that It was built after school and other activities. Tbh I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I have decided to make It, I have never actually used it besides while testing it for the contest.\nHow it works #\rOne-key keyboard (or okk. for short) works by measuring how much light is emitted by the LED onto a photoresistor, while the key is not pressed, the LED is not covered so all the light can shine onto the photoresistor. But when it is pressed by some amount, the key starts blocking some of the light so the photoresistor\u0026rsquo;s resistance changes. And when this photoresistor is connected with another one, and voltage divider is created by them. You can measure this resistance difference (or, to be more accurate, now a voltage drop) with arduino\u0026rsquo;s analog pin. The code can be as short as just a few lines. Additionally I have added another screen, cause It makes okk. look better and also everything nowadays has to have a screen.\nMake your own #\rWhy would you even want to make your own version? Never mind\u0026hellip; Good-ish documentation can be found on okk.\u0026rsquo;s github page. Link above.\nGallery #\rHappy making\n~Simon\n","date":"20 February 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/1725463405247-one-key-keyboard/","section":"Projects","summary":"This is yet another project made for a contest hosted by Cyberdeck Cafe.

In school I mainly program PLCs (we have siemens s7-1200s) and industrial robots (in labs there are two kuka\u0026rsquo;s KR 4 R600, one kuka KR16 and three ABB collaborative robots). At home I love programming Arduinos/ESPs/RaspberryPis, 3D printing (my current 3d printer is Ender-3 S1 Pro). In general just making stuff. Besides projects for myself I am designing PCBs for my classmate and making smaller projects for friends and fixing stuff for my family.\nI am experienced in\u0026hellip; #\r\u0026hellip;Programming PLCs. Except for Siemens\u0026rsquo; PLCs in my school I have programmed Astraada ONE Compact in Codesys and Beckhoff C6017-0020 in TwinCat 3 \u0026hellip;Programming PLCs to communicate with Robots. I have done 1 month long internship, where my task was to program Astraada one to communicate with K-Roset via TCP/IP and then later via .DLL communication protocol provided with Kawasaki robots \u0026hellip;Programming in general. My language of choice for most things remains Python (3.10 or 3.7 cause newer version suck and luck libraries I need), but I am trying to switch to C (Why C and not C++? Cause I am making a project with my friend and he insisted on using it) \u0026hellip;Designing 3D models. As you might have seen, most of my projects are 3D printed and about two years ago I switched to Fusion360 from Tinkercad. From that point I have made countless projects ranging from simple flashlights to a concept of a 3D printer \u0026hellip;Making PCBs. That is a skill I am still learning but for over a year now (written in sept. 2024) I have been designing PCBs in KiCad for various projects \u0026hellip;Creating electrical installations. In 2023 I successfully got eligibility to work with installations to 1kV \u0026hellip;Servicing heavy machinery. For a few years now I have been regularly maintaining dozers, diggers, loaders and tractors There are probably many more things that I forgot to write here\u0026hellip; #\rAnyways I hope you enjoyed reading sth about me and will enjoy reading about my projects. Happy stay here and I hope to see you again. My biggest dream is to inspire somebody to start their own maker journey. It might be frustrating but is a lot of fun. I promise.\nStay safe and happy making #\r~Simon #\r","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Glinek","summary":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Simon #\rI\u0026rsquo;m an 18yo robotics engineering student.

Also, It\u0026rsquo;s perfect place for my friends and me to work on projects together.\nVision of ANUlab #\rI envision ANUlab to be something more than just a company that sells products. There are gonna be two main branches:\nproducts - actual products that are gonna be sold. I want ANU to sell tools for makers and for \u0026ldquo;non engineering\u0026rdquo; people so that anyone can get into making, improve their projects and create them easier. As well as to simplify repairing devices thanks to those easy to use tools. free projects - at the moment I have one in mind. A website where tutorials and courses for creating projects, learning programming and more are gonna be posted for FREE. All the money earned from products branch are gonna go back into developing products and into free projects. Future of ANUlab #\rThere are big plans for ANUlab. In the near future I am going to start working on ANU’s first product. Or should I say, improving one project - Otsi.
