Due to my overuse of computer and phone, even though it is important for what I do. There are two ways to contact me, either via [Discord](https://discord.com/) **@glinek_tronic** or via email **simon@glinek.tech**

I am open to talk about anything, if you have any questions about my projects or want files for them. I will be more than happy to try and help you. So massage me anytime and I will try to respond as quickly as possible.
