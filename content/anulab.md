## What is ANUlab?
Anulab (or ANU for short) is an organization of mine. For now I use it only as a place to post projects (I just prefere when my projects are made under some brand, It just looks more professional). Also, It's perfect place for my friends and me to work on projects together. 

## Vision of ANUlab
I envision ANUlab to be something more than just a company that sells products. There are gonna be two main branches:
* products - actual products that are gonna be sold. I want ANU to sell tools for makers and for "non engineering" people so that anyone can get into making, improve their projects and create them easier. As well as to simplify repairing devices thanks to those easy to use tools.
* free projects - at the moment I have one in mind. A website where tutorials and courses for creating projects, learning programming and more are gonna be posted for FREE.
All the money earned from **products branch** are gonna go back into developing products and into **free projects**.

## Future of ANUlab
There are big plans for ANUlab. In the near future I am going to start working on ANUâ€™s first product. Or should I say, improving one project - Otsi. Bc yes, I plan to release Otsi mk2 as ANUlab's first product.

## ANUlab's github
On [ANUlab's github{{< icon "github" >}}](https://github.com/A-N-Ulab) you can find many of my projects, e.g. Otsi and Atrovel are documented there.
