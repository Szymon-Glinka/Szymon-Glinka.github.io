## What is ANUlab?
Anulab is an organization of mine. For now I use it only as a place to post projects (I just prefere when my projects are made under some brand, It just looks more professional). Also, It's perfect place for my friends and me to work on projects together. 

## Future of ANUlab
In the future I plan to turn ANUlab into a proper company, I have some ideas for products. But sadly now there are other things to be done.

## ANUlab's github
On [ANUlab's github{{< icon "github" >}}](https://github.com/A-N-Ulab) you can find many of my projects, e.g. Otsi and Atrovel are documented there.
