This is one of my one day projects. Created to help me keep focus without my phone or computer. It's a simple timer that can also tell time. For maximum accuracy it syncs with wifi.

# Story
This is an actual one day project. Which is something that is not common with my creations. Originated as a way to stay more focused while doing my math assignments. And ended up as a handy clock and timer to remember about brakes when making my projects. VeyToy is based on Heltec LoRa v3, a little overkill I know. But it was my only Arduino/ESP on hand that had a built-in display (didn't want to add extra wires). And, being completely honest, at the beginning it was supposed to be battery powered, but I'm too lazy... One day project after all.

# Build your own
Honestly, if you want to build one. You are on your own. I don't plan on releasing any files for it. It's not refined and creating documentation for it is just too much effort for a project like this. But if you want VeyToy's code, contact me and I will happily send them to you.
