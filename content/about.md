## Hi, I'm Simon
I'm an 18yo robotics engineering student. In school I mainly program PLCs (we have siemens s7-1200s) and industrial robots (in labs there are two kuka's KR 4 R600, one kuka KR16 and three ABB collaborative robots). At home I love programming Arduinos/ESPs/RaspberryPis, 3D printing (my current 3d printer is Ender-3 S1 Pro). In general just making stuff. Besides projects for myself I am designing PCBs for my classmate and making smaller projects for friends and fixing stuff for my family.


## I am experienced in...
* ...Programming PLCs. Except for Siemens' PLCs in my school I have programmed Astraada ONE Compact in Codesys and Beckhoff C6017-0020 in TwinCat 3
* ...Programming PLCs to communicate with Robots. I have done 1 month long internship, where my task was to program Astraada one to communicate with K-Roset via TCP/IP and then later via .DLL communication protocol provided with Kawasaki robots
* ...Programming in general. My language of choice for most things remains Python (3.10 or 3.7 cause newer version suck and luck libraries I need), but I am trying to switch to C (Why C and not C++? Cause I am making a project with my friend and he insisted on using it)
* ...Designing 3D models. As you might have seen, most of my projects are 3D printed and about two years ago I switched to Fusion360 from Tinkercad. From that point I have made countless projects ranging from simple flashlights to a concept of a 3D printer
* ...Making PCBs. That is a skill I am still learning but for over a year now (written in sept. 2024) I have been designing PCBs in KiCad for various projects
* ...Creating electrical installations. In 2023 I successfully got eligibility to work with installations to 1kV
* ...Servicing heavy machinery. For a few years now I have been regularly maintaining dozers, diggers, loaders and tractors


### There are probably many more things that I forgot to write here...
Anyways I hope you enjoyed reading sth about me and will enjoy reading about my projects. Happy stay here and I hope to see you again. My biggest dream is to inspire somebody to start their own maker journey. It might be frustrating but is a lot of fun. I promise.


### Stay safe and happy making
#### ~Simon
